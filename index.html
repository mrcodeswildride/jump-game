    <h1>Jump Game</h1>

    <p>
      This program finds a solution for randomly generated boards. The game is played by starting at
      the first square, and jumping up to the number spaces shown on the square. For example, if the
      first square has a 3, you can jump 1, 2, or 3 spaces. Repeat this process until you reach the
      last square. Numbers range from 0 to 3.
